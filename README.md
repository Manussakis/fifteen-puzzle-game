Fifteen Puzzle Game
===================

### Rearrange the pieces with as few moves as possible

**Instructions:**
1. In the "Shuffle moves" input, type how many moves you want the board to be shuffled with (any value between **1** and **80**).
2. Click on the "Shuffle" button and watch the pieces shuffling around.
3. Try rearranging the board with the same (or even fewer) number of moves than it was initially shuffled by clicking on the pieces with space to move. The pieces should be placed in ascending order from left to right, up to down.
